DOMAIN: DATA SCIENCE

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

**THIS PROJECT IS AN IMAGE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM BUILT USING PYTHON, PYTORCH, AND TORCHVISION TO CLASSIFY IMAGES OF CATS AND DOGS. IT IMPLEMENTS A CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) FOR TRAINING AND TESTING ON A DATASET STORED IN A STRUCTURED FOLDER FORMAT. THE SYSTEM ALSO ALLOWS PREDICTIONS ON NEW TEST IMAGES AND SAVES THE TRAINED MODEL FOR REUSE.THE PROJECT FOLLOWS A COMPLETE DEEP LEARNING WORKFLOW, STARTING FROM DATASET LOADING TO MODEL TRAINING, EVALUATION, PREDICTION, AND SAVING THE TRAINED MODEL.THE SCRIPT (MAIN.PY) AUTOMATICALLY DETECTS THE DATASET PATH, LOADS THE IMAGES, PREPROCESSES THEM USING TORCHVISION TRANSFORMS, AND TRAINS A CNN FOR CLASSIFICATION.
 KEY STEPS IN THE PROJECT
1. DATA LOADING
USES TORCHVISION.DATASETS.IMAGEFOLDER TO LOAD IMAGES FROM DATASET/TRAIN/.
APPLIES IMAGE TRANSFORMATIONS SUCH AS RESIZING TO (128, 128) AND CONVERTING IMAGES TO TENSORS.
USES DATALOADER TO CREATE BATCHES FOR TRAINING.

2️. MODEL DEFINITION
A CUSTOM CNN MODEL (SIMPLECNN) IS BUILT WITH:
TWO CONVOLUTIONAL LAYERS (CONV2D)
RELU ACTIVATIONS
MAXPOOLING LAYERS
FULLY CONNECTED LAYERS (LINEAR) FOR CLASSIFICATION

3.MODEL TRAINING
LOSS FUNCTION: CROSSENTROPYLOSS
OPTIMIZER: ADAM WITH A LEARNING RATE OF 0.001
THE MODEL IS TRAINED FOR 5 EPOCHS, UPDATING WEIGHTS USING BACKPROPAGATION.

4️.EVALUATION
AFTER TRAINING, THE MODEL IS SWITCHED TO EVALUATION MODE.
ACCURACY IS CALCULATED BY COMPARING PREDICTIONS WITH TRUE LABELS ON THE TRAINING DATASET.

5️. PREDICTIONS ON NEW IMAGES
THE SCRIPT CHECKS A TEST_IMAGES/ FOLDER.
FOR EACH IMAGE IN THE FOLDER, IT APPLIES THE SAME PREPROCESSING, RUNS THE TRAINED MODEL, AND PRINTS THE PREDICTED CLASS.
THE RESULT IS ALSO VISUALIZED USING MATPLOTLIB.

6️.MODEL SAVING
THE TRAINED MODEL WEIGHTS ARE SAVED AS CAT_DOG_MODEL.PTH USING TORCH.SAVE(), ALLOWING FUTURE PREDICTIONS WITHOUT RETRAINING.

 TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED
PYTHON – CORE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.
PYTORCH – FOR BUILDING, TRAINING, AND EVALUATING THE CNN MODEL.
TORCHVISION – FOR DATASETS, TRANSFORMS, AND IMAGE HANDLING.
PIL (PILLOW) – FOR LOADING AND PROCESSING IMAGES.
MATPLOTLIB – FOR VISUALIZING PREDICTIONS.
OS – FOR HANDLING DATASET AND TEST IMAGE PATHS DYNAMICALLY.

    APPLICATIONS OF THIS PROJECT
 PET CLASSIFICATION: USED IN APPLICATIONS TO DETECT WHETHER AN UPLOADED IMAGE IS OF A CAT OR A DOG.
 EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES: DEMONSTRATES CNN ARCHITECTURE, DATA PREPROCESSING, AND TRAINING IN PYTORCH.
 MODEL DEPLOYMENT: THE TRAINED CAT_DOG_MODEL.PTH CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO A FLASK/DJANGO WEB APP FOR REAL-TIME PREDICTIONS.
 TRANSFER LEARNING BASE: THE SAME STRUCTURE CAN BE MODIFIED FOR OTHER CLASSIFICATION TASKS (E.G., FLOWER CLASSIFICATION, DISEASE DETECTION IN PLANTS).
